Hi everyone, I'm a newbie!
I'm only level 1, how long does it take to get to level 4?
I don't know if I can hold on until the day I get WL
Let's talk about something else, go to sleep
Let's chat and upgrade slowly, as long as you stick to it very fast
everyone stay active
Is the chat experience value the same in any channel?
I wonder what people in other language areas are talking about, is it also awkward? Hahaha

You don't have to work or go to school?
I can only chat when I have time at work
Want to talk about the movie Water Point XP
I'm crazy, I don't know how long it will take
Before my hand typing was broken hahaha
Sedentary activities
Craving for fried chicken, fried chicken is perfect for cola
tired tired
It's dinner time, brothers, you can't stop eating
My phone is about to be stabbed
This project is really good
come on! Come on
You're bald and stronger
